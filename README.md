## How It Works

### Daily Processes

- **6:00 AM**: Daily optimization runs, calculating energy thresholds, analyzing hourly data, and generating a summary.
- **6:05 AM**: The system implements the daily optimization, setting the working mode to Time-of-Use with disabled battery, and potentially scheduling a mode change.
- **Every 5 minutes**: The system checks if it's time to change the mode to Maximize Self-Consumption.
- **5:00 PM**: The system switches to an appropriate mode based on the current month.
- **9:00 PM**: The system calculates the charging strategy for the next day.

### Continuous Processes

- The system manages inverter export based on spot prices, triggered by price changes or hourly checks.<br><br>


## Working Modes

This package supports several working modes to optimize your Huawei solar battery system:

### 1. Maximize Self Consumption

**Description**: This mode prioritizes using the energy generated by your solar panels to power your home and charge your battery, minimizing the amount of energy drawn from the grid.

**Use Case**: Ideal for households looking to reduce their reliance on grid electricity and maximize the use of their solar energy production.

**When to Use**: 
- During periods of high solar production
- When grid electricity prices are consistently high

### 2. Time of Use (Battery Charge / Discharge)

**Description**: This mode optimizes battery charging and discharging based on time-of-use electricity rates. It charges the battery when electricity rates are low and discharges when rates are high.

**Use Case**: Perfect for users with time-of-use electricity tariffs who want to minimize their electricity costs.

**When to Use**:
- In areas with significant differences between peak and off-peak electricity rates
- To reduce strain on the grid during peak hours
- To take advantage of lower nighttime electricity rates for charging

**Default TOU Periods** (configured in this package)
- Off-peak (charging): 00:01 - 05:59 (all days)
- Peak (discharging): 06:00 - 10:00 (all days)
- Peak (discharging): 17:00 - 23:59 (all days)

These default periods are set to optimize battery usage based on typical daily electricity demand patterns. The system charges the battery during early morning hours when demand is typically low, and discharges during morning and evening peak hours. You can adjust these periods to match your specific utility's rate schedule or your household's energy consumption patterns.

### 3. Fully Fed to Grid

**Description**: In this mode, all excess solar energy is fed back to the grid instead of being stored in the battery and in some circumstances will also drain the battery.

**Use Case**: Useful in scenarios where feeding energy to the grid is more beneficial than storing it. Especially if electricity price for selling is high.

**When to Use**:
- When grid feed-in tariffs are particularly high
- During periods of consistently high electricity spot prices
- If there's a need to reduce battery cycling to extend its lifespan

Note: This working mode is not in use by any automations at the moment, but script is added if needed.

### Grid Export Management

**Description**: This feature allows you to enable or disable the export of excess energy to the grid based on current electricity spot prices.

**Use Case**: Helps optimize the financial benefits of your solar system by exporting energy when it's most profitable.

**How it Works**:
- When enabled, the system will export excess energy to the grid if the current spot price is above a set threshold.
- When disabled, excess energy will be used to charge the battery or will be curtailed if the battery is full.

**When to Use**:
- Enable during periods of high electricity spot prices to maximize revenue from energy export
- Disable when spot prices are low, and it's more beneficial to store energy in the battery for later use

By utilizing these working modes and the grid export management feature, you can tailor your Huawei solar battery system's operation to your specific needs, local energy market conditions, and personal energy goals.<br><br>


## EV Charging

This package now includes features to optimize battery usage when an electric vehicle (EV) is charging. Here's how it works:

### EV Charging Detection

The system monitors the state of EV charging using a binary sensor (`binary_sensor.hsbo_ev_charging`). When EV charging starts or stops, it triggers specific actions to optimize energy usage.

### Behavior During EV Charging

When EV charging starts:
1. The system switches to a special Time-of-Use (TOU) mode where battery charging and discharging are disabled.
2. This ensures that all available power (from solar and grid) is directed to charging the EV, without drawing from or storing energy in the home battery.
3. The current priority mode is set to "ev_charging" to indicate this special state.

When EV charging stops:
1. The system reverts to the recommended working mode (either standard TOU or Maximize Self Consumption).
2. This allows the home battery to resume normal operation based on the current energy situation and time of day.

### Benefits

- Prioritizes EV charging when needed, ensuring the fastest possible charge for your vehicle.
- Prevents unnecessary cycling of the home battery during EV charging, which could reduce overall system efficiency.
- Automatically returns to optimal home energy management when EV charging is complete.

### Configuration

To use this feature, ensure you have a binary sensor set up in Home Assistant that indicates when your EV is charging. Update the `input_text.hsbo_ev_charger_status` in the package configuration to point to your EV charging sensor.

This EV charging optimization works seamlessly with the other features of the Huawei Solar Battery Optimization package, providing a comprehensive energy management solution for homes with both solar systems and electric vehicles.

Please note, if you already has existing automations configuring the Huawai working mode, these should be disabled or removed as the Daily mode management automation would conflict or reset any other configurations.<br><br>
